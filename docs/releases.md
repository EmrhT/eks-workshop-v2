# EKS Workshop - Releases

The EKS Workshop will publish a new version on the last Friday of each month containing all PRs merged to the `main` branch during that time. This will update the content on https://eksworkshop.com and publish a new version to Workshop Studio for AWS events. The changes for the release each month will be publish as a GitHub Release with a corresponding changelog. 

There may be releases published off-schedule for specific events like re:Invent and Kubecon, as well as updates made during the month for critical bug fixes.

Each release will have a corresponding GitHub milestone associated with it to track the changes that will be released during that interval. This allows contributors to understand when their contribution will be published, and users of the workshop to understand what changes will be published ahead of time.
